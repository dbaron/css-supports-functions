# Explainer: New functions for CSS `@supports` rules

## Background

* summarize css-conditional-3
* these would be proposals for css-conditional-4

## Selector syntax

* probably highest priority
  * use case of scrollbar styling
* should not copy quirks about `::-webkit-*` pseudo-elements

## CSS Rules

* does putting rules inside `@supports` conditions cause grammar problems?  readability problems?
* how useful is it?
